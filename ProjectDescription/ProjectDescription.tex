\section{\textsc{What user problem is your product/device trying to solve?}}
	Typically, communication between a base station and an autonomous drone using dipole antennas is power intensive for two reasons: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The base station needs to transmit over a large area because the drone could be in a wide range of places.
		\item The drone needs to transmit a signal powerful enough to be detected by a dipole on the base station which is not directionally sensitive and could be very far away.
	\end{enumerate}
	Currently, this is handled in a careful balancing act: designers seek to use as little power as possible while achieving the necessary signal to noise ratios. However, because a signal attenuates with the square of distance, this nonetheless can require a lot of energy.  More energy requires more weight. More battery weight inevitably means that some other features on the drone need to be cut. This could be speed, agility, or simply the removal of valuable electronic add-ons. From this perspective, the user is the drone and the problem is weight. \\
	
	In addition to power concerns, the range of the drone is severely limited by conventional means of communication.  A standard dipole radiates omnidirectionally, meaning that the majority of the signal is lost to the environment.  This seriously limits the operating range of the drone.  \\
	
	As previously stated, dipoles radiate omnidirectionally, which can be a security concern.  A ground receiver can potentially snoop on the communication channel and obtain sensitive information.  This is a concern when received data needs to be secure.  \\

	Standard communication protocols have limited bandwidth for communication and scientific data.  Applications that require large amounts of data consume significant bandwidth and therefore are limited by the carrier frequency band.  Operating on a single channel requires multiplexing data and command/control signals, further increasing the complexity and bandwidth requirements of the system.  

	
\section{\textsc{What is our proposed solution?}}
	We propose using a stacked phased array to solve these problems.  A phased array is an array of dipoles that allow for a highly directive beam pattern to form.  This allows the user to transmit over a larger distance using less power when compared to a single dipole transmitting over this distance.  A stacked phased array concurrently uses two or more frequency isolated phased array systems.  We propose using both a 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz in our stacked phased array system. \\
	
	The range of a phased array is significantly longer than a dipole due to directivity.  This will enable the base station to receive and transmit to the drone antenna at long ranges even if the drone only supports a standard dipole or low power signal.  \\
	
	To address the concern of data security, the high directivity of the signal allows it to point to a very small area.  In essence, the phased array can be directed at the target (i.e. the drone), thereby reducing the possibility that another person would be able to receive the signal themselves.\\
	
	Inherently by using two isolated frequency bands the system gains a much greater bandwidth.  Additionally, using two isolated bands allows separation of data and command/control.  This removes the need for multiplexing which reduces complexity.  We propose to use the 2.4 GHz channel for data as it has a greater bandwidth and is well suited for large data throughput, and to use the 900 MHz channel for command/control.\\

\section{\textsc{Who needs this? Who will benefit from this?}}
There are three major beneficiaries: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Researchers} -- the drone is intended as a lightweight surveillance system. The drone needs to be able to travel significant distances in potentially hard to reach areas and transmit data back to the base. This can be used for weather analysis, video streaming, or act as a relay station.
		\item \textbf{The autonomous vehicle market} -- most people within the market are using standard dipole antennas, and are dealing with all of the shortcomings as a result (discussed earlier). Using a phased array has a very large advantage to this market, as it would allow for greater range for the drone, enabling a larger area of influence for the payload without needing to move the base station. 
		\item \textbf{Military applications} -- a longer range drone with higher communication security are desirable features for applications such as military surveillance and providing secure communications to units on the ground.
	\end{enumerate}

\section{\textsc{What capabilities does your product/device provide that are not available without this?}}
A phased array at the base station allows the drone to transmit a lower power signal over a larger distance because it tracks and dynamically tunes itself to receive the signal. The base station also transmits lower power signals because it can direct its beam toward the drone. Additionally, the directivity of the phased array improves the security of the data sent between the drone and the user.  Using multiple frequency bands yields higher data throughput.  With this in mind, some potential use cases are as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Streaming high definition video at long ranges from the base station.
		\item Collecting weather and atmospheric data with high data rates.
		\item Relaying sensitive data from the drone to the base station.
	\end{itemize}

\section{\textsc{What are the top project risks you perceive at this time?}}
	At this time, the risks we see are the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item RF design is delicate to small design changes, especially when antennas are concerned.  Much of our time will be dedicated to the antenna design if we decide to go down this route.
		\item We are leveraging existing hardware designs into our project.  This may pose a problem if the existing designs do not meet our specifications.
		\item We will need develop a communications interface between the base station and the drone.  Developing the firmware could prove more time-costly than we plan.
	\end{itemize}

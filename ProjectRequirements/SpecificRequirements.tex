	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The system should be able to have a connection to a drone at 900 MHz up to a distance of 20 miles.
		\item The system should be able to track the drone by steering the phased array.
		\item The system should be able to be mounted on the roof of a car.
		\item The system should be able to connect to at most 4 drones at the same time.
		\item The system should be able to transmit 5 user commands per second.
		\item The system will not overheat.

		Marketing Requirements & Engineering Requirements & Justification \\ \hline \hline
		3 & The phased array dimensions will not exceed L x W x H & The phased array needs to be small enough to possibly be mounted on a car. \\ \hline
		1,2,4 & The elevation should be from 0$^{\circ}$ to 90$^{\circ}$ & The drone will fly quite low and 20 miles away, the phased array needs to be able to communicate at low elevations.\\\hline
		1,2,4 & The azimuth should be from 360$^{\circ}$ & The drone can be flying anywhere around the phased array, so it needs to be able to transmit in a full circle. \\\hline
		6 & The system will have temperature monitoring. & To detect if the system is overheating or not, there will need to be temperature monitoring. \\\hline
		1,3,4  & The phased array steers at 100Hz. & To keep the phased array tracking the drone, it needs to update consistently. \\\hline
		 &  & \\\hline

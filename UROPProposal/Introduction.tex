\section{\Large Introduction}
	Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles (UAVs), which are used for surveillance systems and remote sensing, have many limitations in communication capabilities.  Steering a beam to connect to a drone is done by mechanically moving a large antenna to aim the beam towards the drone.  \\
	
	We propose to design a phased array system to connect base stations to drones without moving parts.  This design allows for faster steering, connecting to multiple drones, fast \& secure data transfer, and a more mobile base station (car mountable).  This project is under the guidance of Prof. Brian Argrow, and the phased array system will be used for long range weather surveillance.

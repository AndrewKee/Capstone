\section*{\Large Abstract}
	The Radio Agnostic Phased Array is a new design that will provide the ability to communicate with drones at large ranges with fast data transfer.  This product will be used for a weather surveillance system intended to record data of tornados.  Currently, systems do not exist that provide fast steering, multiple drone connections, and small form factor for mounting on moving vehicles.  This new system aims to provide all the above features to advance research and assist in new and upcoming communication technologies.

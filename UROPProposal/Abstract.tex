\section*{\Large Abstract}
	The Radio Agnostic Phased Array is a new design that will provide the ability to communicate with Unmanned Aircraft Systems at large ranges with fast data transfer.  This product will be used for a weather surveillance system intended to record data of tornadoes and other instances of severe weather.  Currently, systems do not exist that provide multiple drone connections at once and a low profile for mounting on moving vehicles.  This new system aims to provide all the above features to advance research and assist in new and upcoming communication technologies.
